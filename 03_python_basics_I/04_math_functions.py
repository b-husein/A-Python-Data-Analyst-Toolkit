# previously we mentioned number data types.
# and some actions that we can take.

# math functions are actions we can take
# or perform on data types like numbers

# round function will round number to bigger or smaller decimal 
print(round(3.9)) # it will round to 4;

# abs function which returns absolute value of an argument
print(abs(-20)) # absolute value of -20 is 20;

# we have a big number of different math functions
# we can Google them if we are more interested
