# WHY ARE THERE SO MANY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES?

""" 
- We don't need to know all languages to be successful;
- it's better to specialize in one.
- on Wikipedia we can take a look and see about hundreds of programming languages.

- Different programming languages are good with different things; 
- like building a house, we need multiple tools; 
- every language is good for some specific purpose (diversity).

- Python is good for dev productivity because of simplicity.
- Write less lines for certain things.
