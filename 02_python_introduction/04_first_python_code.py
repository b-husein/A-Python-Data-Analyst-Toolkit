# first thing - to print simple function in Python;
# another hint .py extension with python files.
# in order to see the output or result, we need to run 
# a command prompt (in VScode or Git Bash) 
# and we can do that by typing the following line of code in terminal:
# py name_of_the_file
# and we will see the output in terminal.
# ctrl + K to clear terminal

# print('Hi there!')

# let's make it little bit more dynamic;
# using input function to capture some information.

# input('Please write your name: ')

# this is where code becomes interesting because we can store
# this information on our computer.
# let's assign the value of input into memory.

name = input('What is your name? ')

print('Hello ' + name)
