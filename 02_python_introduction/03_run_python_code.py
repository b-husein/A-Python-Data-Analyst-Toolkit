# DOWNLOAD PYTHON TRANSLATION SERVICE FROM OFFICIAL WEBSITE; 

""" 
- To write Python code we can use: 

    - Terminal
    - Code editors (like VScode or Sublime)
    - IDEs (like PyCharm, Spyder)
    - Notebooks (like Jupiter Notebooks)

- Before we install any of these editors, we can actually first write some code in Python

- using repl.it or glot.io; and using this we can save Python files online.

- we don't have to download translation service but we can write Python code.
