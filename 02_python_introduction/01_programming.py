# WHAT IS A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

"""
- A way to give instruction to computers. Without code computer programs wouldn't do anything. 

- Computers don't understand human language. They speak in 0 and 1; machine language.

- Humans developed programming languages that are in between human and machine language.

- Some programming languages are lower level - closer to machine language; 

- Other programming languages are higher levels - closer to English language;

- We have programming languages such as Pyton, JS, Java etc. and somehow we need to convert these languages into 

- ones and zeros; so we will use 'translator' to translate files that we write into machine language.

- This translator is another program written by human - interpreter or compiler. 

- Python usually uses interpreter that translates line by line through our code and execute it. 

- Compiler is different, it takes the entire file and turns it into machine code. 

- When we are writing code, we are typing it in language that is human readable and 

- we are giving it to one of the translators (interpreter or compiler)

- and these spit out code that is able to run on our machines. 

- in order for us to be able to write Python, we need to download this translation service.
