# EXPLORING CONTAINERS, CLASSES and OBJECTS

''' 
- Previously we talked about variables that can have a data type like int, float and str;
- but variable holds only a sinlge value. 
- Containers are objects that can contain multiple values. These values can have the same or different data types.
- The four built-in containers in Python are:

    1. Lists
    2. Tuples
    3. Dictionaries
    4. Sets

- Containers are also called iterables; That is, you can visit or traverse through each of the values in a given container object.

# 1. LISTS

''' 
- A list contains a set of values that are stored in sequential order. 
- A list is mutable which means that we can modify, add or delete values in a list, making it a flexible container.
