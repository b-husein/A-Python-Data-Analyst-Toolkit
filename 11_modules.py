#MODULES IN PYTHON

''' 
- A module is a Python file with a .py extension. It can be thought of as a section of a physical library.
- Module contains sections that are related to one another.
- For example, the matplotlib module contains all functions related to plotting graphs. 
- A module can contain another module. The matplotlib module, for instance, contains a module called pyplot.

- A module can be imported using the import keyword, followed by the name of the module:

    # CODE:
    import matplotlib

- We can also import part of a module (a submodule or a function) using the from keyword. 
- Example with the cosine function from the math module:

    # CODE:
    from math import cos

- Creating and importing a customized module in Python requires the following steps:

    1. Type 'idle' in the search bar next to the start menu. Once the Python shell
    is open, create a new file by selecting: File -> New file.

    2. Create some functions with similar functionality. As an example, here, we are creating
    a simple module that creates two functions - sin_angle and cos_angle. These functions
    calculate the sin and cosine of an angle (given in degrees).

    # CODE:
